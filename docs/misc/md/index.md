## What is markdown and why should you care ?

Markdown is a ==lightweight== markup language used to format text.
Why is it better than more conventional writing applications ?

We have 4 main apps to write text.

<div class="grid" markdown>

**:material-note-text: notepad.exe** allows you to write fast, but is unreadeable afterwards 

**:material-file-word: Word** is slower (you need to use your mouse), and a bit prettier to look at

**:material-language-html5: HTML** is excruciatingly painful to write, but has a good rendering

**:material-language-markdown: Markdown** is as fast as notepad, and renders like HTML
{ .card }

</div>

You can use markdown for all your writing needs: taking notes, writing a letter, building documentation ... 

## How easy is Markdown, actually ?

Here is an example of some source code.  

<div class="grid" markdown>

```html title="hello.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            Hello !
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>
            Hello !
        </h1>
        <p>This is some text</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```md title="hello.md"
---
title: Hello!
---

# Hello !

This is some text
```

Without hunderds of lines of CSS, the render of the HTML would be quite ugly.

Markdown would render just like the page you're reading now.<br> In fact, it was written in markdown. You can read its source code by clicking the :material-file-eye: icon at the top of the page, near the table of contents. 

</div>
